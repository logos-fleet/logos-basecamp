# Logos Basecamp

A Qt/QML desktop application with a plugin-based architecture. It uses Nix for builds and has an MCP-based QML inspector for UI automation.

## Building & Running

```bash
# Build the app
nix build

# Build + run directly
nix build && ./result/bin/LogosBasecamp

# Iterate on QML without rebuilding — relaunch to pick up edits.
DEV_QML_PATH=$PWD/src nix build && DEV_QML_PATH=$PWD/src ./result/bin/LogosBasecamp
```

QML lives in feature-axis qt_add_qml_module modules (Basecamp.Sidebar,
.AppManager, .Settings, .Shell, plus .Backend for C++ types) — bytecode is
embedded in the main_ui plugin. No runtime QML disk cache, so the qrc-keyed cache
staleness bug doesn't apply.

### `DEV_QML_PATH` — iterate on view layouts without rebuilding

Point `DEV_QML_PATH` at a directory whose layout mirrors the QML URI hierarchy
(typically `<repo>/src`, which contains `Basecamp/Sidebar/`,
`Basecamp/Shell/`, etc.). MainContainer's three view-entry `setSource` calls
will read from `$DEV_QML_PATH/Basecamp/<Feature>/<Entry>.qml` instead of the
embedded qrc resource. Relaunch the app to pick up edits.

Covered entries:
- `Basecamp/Sidebar/SidebarPanel.qml` (MainContainer)
- `Basecamp/Shell/ContentViews.qml` (MainContainer)
- `Basecamp/Shell/OverlayDialogs.qml` (MainContainer)
- `Basecamp/Shell/WelcomePage.qml` (WorkspaceArea — central widget when no docks are open)

Sub-components imported by those entries (anything reached via
`import Basecamp.<Feature>`) still load from the embedded qrc — qt_add_qml_module's
auto-generated qmldirs live in the build dir, not the source tree, so the
engine has no on-disk qmldir to prefer over the embedded one. Editing a
delegate/widget inside e.g. `Basecamp.Settings` requires a `nix build`.
Convention matches `logos-standalone-app`'s `DEV_QML_PATH` (see that repo's
README) extended for our multi-entry layout.

## Testing

```bash
# Smoke test (validates app starts without QML errors)
nix build .#smoke-test -L

# Build test framework (one-time, rebuilds when logos-qt-mcp changes)
nix build .#logos-qt-mcp -o result-mcp

# UI integration tests (app must be running first)
node tests/ui-tests.mjs

# UI integration tests headless (CI mode)
node tests/ui-tests.mjs --ci ./result/bin/LogosBasecamp

# Hermetic CI test via Nix
nix build .#integration-test -L
```

## App Structure

- **Sidebar** (left): Contains app plugin icons (top/middle) and system buttons at the bottom (Dashboard, Modules, Settings)
- **Plugins** appear as sidebar icons: `package_manager_ui`
- Plugins are loaded from `~/Library/Application Support/Logos/LogosBasecampDev/plugins/`
- Main UI is in `src/Basecamp/` (the main_ui plugin), organised by feature: `Sidebar/`, `AppManager/`, `Settings/`, `Shell/`, `Icons/`

## C++ Architecture

The backend is split into four classes with a unidirectional dependency graph:

```
MainUIBackend (facade, QML-facing — owns the other three as Qt children)
    │
    ├─► CoreModuleManager    (wraps logos_core_* C API, stats polling)
    │       ▲
    │       │ (uses for all C API calls)
    ├─► UIPluginManager       (UI plugin widgets, app launcher, unload cascade)
    │       ▲
    │       │ (queries for installType / missing-deps / dependents;
    │       │  provides intersectWithLoaded / teardownUiPluginWidget)
    └─► PackageCoordinator    (package_manager IPC, install/uninstall/upgrade
                               orchestration, install & uninstall-cascade dialogs)
```

### MainUIBackend (`app/MainUIBackend.h/.cpp`)
Thin QML-facing facade. Holds only navigation state (`m_currentActiveSectionIndex`, `m_sections`). Every QML-visible slot/signal is a one-line delegation into one of the three managers. The `coreModules()` Q_PROPERTY is the one exception — it composes data from multiple managers (known list + stats from CoreModuleManager, installType from PackageCoordinator). The `cancelPendingAction(name)` slot fans out to both UIPluginManager and PackageCoordinator so the un-involved one no-ops.

### CoreModuleManager (`app/CoreModuleManager.h/.cpp`)
Single owner of the `logos_core_*` C API. Provides thin wrappers: `knownModules()`, `loadedModules()`, `loadModule()`, `unloadModule()`, `unloadModuleWithDependents()`, plus a stats timer that periodically queries `logos_core_get_module_stats`. Nothing else in the app calls the C API directly.

### UIPluginManager (`app/UIPluginManager.h/.cpp`)
Owns UI plugin widget lifecycle in-process: PluginLoader wiring, widget teardown, app launcher state, UI-plugin metadata cache (`m_uiPluginMetadata`) used for load dispatch. Runs the local *unload* cascade (no package_manager involvement). Queries PackageCoordinator for installType / missing-deps / dependents via accessor methods. Exposes `intersectWithLoaded(names)` + `teardownUiPluginWidget(name)` for PackageCoordinator to call during uninstall cascade.

- **Load/unload**: `loadUiModule`, `unloadUiModule`, `loadCoreModule`, `unloadCoreModule` — pre-flight dependency checks, then delegates to CoreModuleManager
- **Unload cascade**: `confirmUnloadCascade`, `cancelUnloadCascade` — single-slot `m_pendingUnload` drives the QML dialog
- **App launcher**: `activateApp`, `onAppLauncherClicked`, `setCurrentVisibleApp`

### PackageCoordinator (`app/PackageCoordinator.h/.cpp`)
Owns every interaction with the `package_manager` LogosAPI module. (Named `PackageCoordinator` rather than `PackageManager` to avoid colliding with the SDK-generated `PackageManager` proxy class.) Event subscriptions, install/uninstall/upgrade IPC, the confirmation dialogs, plus the package-state caches (`m_installTypeByModule`, `m_missingDepsByModule`, `m_blockingDepsByModule` — the same set as the previous one with the reason each entry blocks, `m_dependentsByModule`). Holds the cascade pending slot.

- **Confirmation intents**: `package_manager_ui` raises `basecamp.packages.confirm_install` / `confirm_uninstall` / `confirm_upgrade`; `beginPackageConfirmation()` draws the dialog and takes ownership of answering. The answer IS the permission — PMU removes nothing until it arrives, so the cascade-unload has always finished first. Basecamp initiates no install of its own here.
- **Bound consent**: the dispatch id lives on the thing it is answering (`PendingAction::intentRequestId`, or `m_pendingInstallRequestId` for the cascade-less install), never in a single "whatever is pending" slot. A click on one dialog must not be able to answer another request — the shell's own uninstall dialogs carry no id at all.
- **Undelivered answers**: `finishIntent()` reports whether the broker accepted. `false` means the requester is gone or the dispatch already ended — including when the cascade just tore down PMU itself — so the removal falls back to `performLocalRemoval()` rather than being silently dropped.
- **Cascade confirmation**: `confirmUninstallCascade`, `cancelPendingAction` — drives cascade unload via CoreModuleManager + UIPluginManager, then answers.
- **Metadata refresh**: `refresh()` triggers the full `getInstalledUiPlugins` + `getInstalledPackages` + per-package `resolveFlatDependencies/Dependents` chain; pushes UI metadata to UIPluginManager via `uiPluginsFetched` signal

### App-to-app intents (`app/IntentRegistry`, `app/IntentBroker`)
An app asks for a *capability* (`logos.request("wallet.send", …)`) and the shell picks who services it. Basecamp owns the **disposable** half — resolution, consent, dispatch; the frozen QML surface lives in `logos-view-module-runtime` (`LogosIntent.h`). No policy belongs in the frozen half, so this can be replaced wholesale when the core runtime takes over provider selection.

- **IntentRegistry** — reads `provides` / `uses` / `provides[].params` out of each installed app's `metadata.json`. `ui_qml` only, and that is a design line, not a V1 shortcut: core modules call each other directly through `LogosAPI` with no chooser and nothing to consent to. `logos.*` (the platform's) and `basecamp.*` (this shell's) are both reserved and refused from any on-disk record — the first by the frozen surface, the second by `IntentRegistry`, because which shell owns a prefix is policy.
- **IntentBroker** — the whole lifecycle. Reaches the world through four seams (`IntentEndpoint`, `IntentPresenter`, `IntentChooser`, `IntentInstaller`), all faked in `tests/intent_broker_test.cpp`, so the policy layer is testable with no UI.
- **IntentBridgeAdapter / ShellIntent\*** — bind each UI plugin's `LogosQmlBridge` to the broker, and re-emit chooser/install prompts as QML signals.

Load-bearing invariants, all covered by tests:

- **The requester's `requestId` never leaves its side.** The broker mints a separate `dispatchId`. A response is accepted only if the id is pending, the phase is `Dispatched`, **and** the responding endpoint is pointer-identical to the recorded provider — pointer, not name, so a reloaded app cannot inherit in-flight requests. A failed guard drops silently.
- **`unavailable` merges "nothing installed" with "denied"**, floored at 400 ms, so an app cannot enumerate what you have installed. The install suggestion answers the requester immediately and never completes its request, for the same reason.
- **One dialog at a time.** A second request queues rather than repointing a chooser under the user's cursor — that would be a consent swap.
- **Only a provider's own answer moves the user.** Answering returns them to the requester; the other five `finish()` paths (deadlines, endpoint death, abandon, refusals) never navigate, because nothing on screen would explain it. `"handoff": true` on a `provides` entry opts out entirely — the request existed to take the user somewhere and leave them there. It governs navigation only; when the provider answers (on arrival, or when the user marks the action done) is independent.

### Deep links (`app/links/`)
A `basecamp://` URL from a browser becomes an intent. `SingleInstanceGuard` (socket keyed on the **resolved** user dir, so `--user-dir` still isolates), `LinkUrlInbox` (where argv, the macOS `QFileOpenEvent` and the socket all land), `LinkUrl` (the parser — pure, and the only fully attacker-controlled surface), `LinkRequestCoordinator` (parks until the first registry rebuild, caps one in flight), `SchemeRegistrar` (Linux `.desktop` + Windows `HKCU`; macOS is the plist).

Two invariants, both tested: a link submits under **its own** requester name, never `main_ui`, or the broker would skip the chooser and every web link would dispatch with no consent; and an app's capability is unreachable from a URL until its author sets `"web": true` on the `provides` entry.

Where things are: dialogs in `src/Basecamp/Shell/Intent*Dialog.qml`, wiring in `Shell/OverlayDialogs.qml`, fixtures in `tests/fixtures/intents/`. Full design and known limitations: `docs/app-to-app-intents.md`.

### Construction & Destruction Order
CoreModuleManager is constructed first, UIPluginManager second (receives CoreModuleManager), PackageCoordinator third (receives both). UIPluginManager's `setPackageCoordinator` is called after all three exist, closing the cycle and wiring the `uiPluginsFetched`/`uiModulesChanged`/`launcherAppsChanged`/`coreModulesChanged` signal flow. Qt's reverse-order child destruction tears PackageCoordinator down first (stops emitting), then UIPluginManager (tears down widgets while the C API handle is still valid), then CoreModuleManager.

## Key QML Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/Basecamp/Shell/OverlayDialogs.qml` | Global dialog layer (missing deps, cascade confirm, install gate, install failure) — hosted in a transparent top-level QQuickWidget |
| `src/Basecamp/Shell/ConfirmationDialog.qml` | Multi-mode dialog: `missingDeps`, `unloadCascade`, `upgradeCascade`, `installGate`, `installError` — uninstall confirmation lives in `UninstallDialog.qml` |
| `src/Basecamp/Sidebar/SidebarPanel.qml` | App icons + system nav buttons |
| `src/Basecamp/Settings/AppsInspectorView.qml` | Apps Inspector (UI plugins) — view-only, load/unload; uninstall lives in PMUI |
| `src/Basecamp/Settings/ModuleInspectorView.qml` | Module Inspector (core modules) — view-only, load/unload + stats; uninstall lives in PMUI |
| `src/Basecamp/Shell/ContentViews.qml` | StackLayout switching between Dashboard, Repositories, Apps/Module Inspector |

## QML Inspector (MCP)

Build the logos-qt-mcp package (one-time, includes MCP server + test framework):
```bash
nix build .#logos-qt-mcp -o result-mcp
```

The app runs an inspector server (default: localhost:3768) that the `qml-inspector` MCP tools connect to.

**Prefer high-level tools over tree exploration:**
- Use `qml_find_and_click({text: "..."})` to click buttons, tabs, sidebar items, etc. It supports partial, case-insensitive matching — e.g., `find_and_click({text: "package"})` will find "package_manager_ui".
- Use `qml_find_by_type` and `qml_find_by_property` to locate elements by type or property.
- Use `qml_list_interactive` to get an overview of all clickable/interactive elements (buttons, inputs, delegates) in the current UI state — great for figuring out what's available without exploring the tree.
- Use `qml_screenshot` to see the current state of the app.
- Only fall back to `qml_get_tree` if the above tools can't find what you need or you need to understand the full UI structure.
