# Host-services grant guard for logos-basecamp.
#
# Launches the app with -platform offscreen, opens the Package Manager section
# (which spawns ui-host under the NON-"core" identity "package_manager_ui") and
# asserts that a capability-gated call chain actually COMPLETED — see
# tests/host-services-assert.mjs for why pmui.BackendStore.repositoryCount is
# the witness and why the neighbouring catalog numbers are not.
#
# ── Why this is a check of its own ──────────────────────────────────────────
#
# The same assertion is also registered inside tests/ui-tests.mjs, so
# `integration-test` carries it too. This derivation exists because the failure
# it guards is a PIN failure (basecamp taking a logos-liblogos /
# default-module-loader that predates the grant), and a pin failure deserves a
# gate whose name says what broke rather than one buried in a 17-test UI walk.
# It also adds a second gate the UI harness cannot: a scan of the app's own
# stderr for refusals.
#
# ── The two gates, and why both ─────────────────────────────────────────────
#
#   1. POSITIVE, in-process: a privileged operation must SUCCEED. Cannot pass
#      vacuously — if PMUI never loads, the spec fails rather than skips.
#   2. NEGATIVE, post-run log scan: zero "rejecting unauthorized call" and zero
#      "was not granted the <service> host service". This is an ABSENCE
#      assertion and would pass vacuously on its own (an app that makes no
#      gated calls at all refuses nothing) — it is only meaningful because
#      gate 1 has already established that the calls were made.
#
# Requires Node.js for the test runner and the Qt offscreen platform plugin.
