# Smoke-tests the logos-basecamp binary.
# A pure boot heartbeat: launches the app with -platform offscreen and fails if:
#   - the app crashes before the timeout (non-zero exit that isn't timeout's 124)
#   - the app exits too quickly with code 0 (indicates it didn't start properly)
#
# Deliberately does NOT scan the log for error patterns — QML/plugin error
# assertions belong in integration-test (real UI walk with behavioural
# assertions) and unit-tests, not in a boot heartbeat. Log-regex was fragile
# (missed real bugs that never emitted the exact string, and tripped on any
# stderr line matching the pattern from unrelated code paths like graceful
# shutdown teardown noise).
#
# If the app crashes it exits immediately — the timeout is only ever waited out
# on the happy path (app stays alive and healthy).
#
# The LogosBasecamp launcher (bin/LogosBasecamp) bakes in the correct
# QT_PLUGIN_PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH at build time for dev builds.
# We only need to add the offscreen platform plugin and GL stubs on Linux.
