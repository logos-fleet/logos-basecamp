// that out of the UI: QtLogosCoreRuntime is the only file that names the core,

// is something a future core must keep providing.
// How much of a module's dependency graph a load should pull in. Mirrors the
// runtime's LogosLoadDeps without naming it: FixtureCoreRuntime implements this
// interface against Qt alone, and QtLogosCoreRuntime maps the two.
