// IShellHost / IShellObserver — the whole surface between the Basecamp host and
// its UI shell plugin.
//
// The shell is handed one IShellHost* and nothing else: no LogosAPI*, no
// QtLogosCore*, no TokenManager, so it cannot mint identities, read the token
// store or drive the core lifecycle even by accident.
//
// Only QObject*, QWidget* and Qt value types cross, which is what lets the
// shell link Qt and nothing else — no logos runtime, hence no second copy of
// any runtime singleton. The symbol gate enforces that: widening this surface
// with a logos type fails the build. backendObject() is the escape hatch and is
// safe for the same reason — QML resolves it through the metaobject, so the
// shell never has to name a host C++ type.
//
// IShellHost_abi is compiled into BOTH sides; bump it on ANY vtable change —
// added, removed, reordered or re-signatured methods. A stale plugin is a
// silent vtable mismatch rather than a link error, and the version check is the
// only thing standing between that and a jump through a garbage slot.
//
// The `component-interfaces` INTERFACE library carries this header to both
// targets, so there is exactly one copy and source drift is impossible by
// construction — no guard script needed here, unlike
// logos-module-builder/tests/view-interface-abi.py, which covers two
// independently maintained copies. Binary drift is the real risk, and that is
// what IShellHost_abi covers.
